# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Motivation

During my learning journey I took some time to "product design" a portfolio project that would allow me to:

1. Practice with Html, Css, Js and React.
2. Be big enough (but not too much) to have to deal with scaling problematics and multiple use cases. Scale was also important to make me wonder about how teamwork could be organized.
3. Have a topic that improves my learning. Making the topic about web development knowledge became the obvious choice.

Frontend Wonderland checked all these boxes!

# 2Ô∏è‚É£ Motivation for a V2

As time and knowledge grew in the past weeks, it became evident that the code of the v1 was very redundant.
As this website includes tons of props driven styles, I decided to add styled components, which allows to do that very simply.

It also strips away from the components into the stylesheet all the non prop driven styling, which improved readability for me.

Moreover, dynamically updating object properties linked to state allowed to greatly dry the code.

These new "simple" techniques created so much change that i felt that re-creating the project would be more time efficient.
