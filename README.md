# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Motivation

During my learning journey I took some time to "product design" a portfolio project that would allow me to:

1. Practice with Html, Css, Js and React.
2. Be big enough (but not too much) to have to deal with scaling problematics and multiple use cases. Scale was also important to make me wonder about how teamwork could be organized.
3. Have a topic that improves my learning. Making the topic about web development knowledge became the obvious choice.

Frontend Wonderland checked all these boxes!

# 2Ô∏è‚É£ Motivation for a V2

As time and knowledge grew in the past weeks, it became evident that the code of the v1 was very redundant.
As this website includes tons of props driven styles, I decided to add styled components, which allows to do that very simply.

It also strips away from the components into the stylesheet all the non prop driven styling, which improved readability for me.

Moreover, dynamically updating object properties linked to state allowed to greatly dry the code.

These new "simple" techniques created so much change that i felt that re-creating the project would be more time efficient.

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Roadmap

1. Learn Typescript: I will be taking a 24h+ long in depth course from February 9 2022.
2. I will "Typescript" Frontend Wonderland on the go as an exercice.
3. I will revisit this component that i made: https://github.com/Gynko/ColoredCodeEditor. This will allow me to add articles about code.
4. There are some topics in JS that i want to revisit. Async in particular.
5. I will reevaluate what is smartest to do after this, also based on the potential feedback that i will get on Frontend Wonderland. Testing is big in the list, as well as NextJs and React Native. And then there is Performance. And I want to get back to data structures and algorithms. It never ends! So much fun ü•≥!
